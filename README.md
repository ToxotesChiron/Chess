The Chess repository was created with the humble intention of creating 
a program that could, not only play chess at a more-than-proficient
level, but be able to create problems for others to solve, solve 
problems given to it, run simulations whether with player or itself,
and, lastly, find a possible "end" to a chess game.

As most of you can induce a chess game can, brutely, go on for quite
sometime. All current chess playing programs use algorithms that either,
operate on non-polynomial time, or do not implement a brute analyses.

"Chess" hopes to, using parrallel computing, multiprocessing, and --
a relatively new concept, communal computing, prestine optimization
and simplistic/clean data, and redacted and revolutionary algorithms,
solve the current restrictions and limitations posed by time to create
a perfect chess "player".
